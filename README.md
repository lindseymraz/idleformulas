This is a mod of Zilvarro's Idle Formulas game!

Changes:
- LETTER number format option now uses abbreviations consistent with most incremental games. (The original LETTER format option is still available as ORIGINAL LETTER!)
- Small text fixes: typos, grammar, consistency, etc.

# Idle Formulas
An incremental game about using various mathematical formulas to increase the value of x.
